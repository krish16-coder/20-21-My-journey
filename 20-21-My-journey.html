        <p>Journey of my 20-21 was pretty good I have learnt much new things like - "health is wealth" and most important thing in our life are our loved ones. The good thing is that we all get much time to spend with our family. In this 2020 I had a few difficulties in studies but in this corona i get enough time to do things that wasn't possible during normal days. I also read many books.
